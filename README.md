# budgetingApp
A team collaboration for a budgeting app.

The title displays the current budget for the month and year.
The user has the option to add an income/expenses description along with the amount of money. If the user wants to remove a transaction, they can click the "CLEAR ALL" button.
Income and expenses have their own section so the values entered are more organized to view.
Lastly, a biweekly budget helps the user visualize the finances of each month for up to 4 categories.
